# Vanilla Mob Variants
Though I spent a lot of time thinking up the gimmicks used to make the variants work without a behaviour pack, I only did basic texture edits (the textures in "v" folders) and some of the named variants. Its thanks to the support of the following people that this pack has so many detailed variant textures. So without anything more to say, here are our texture artists and their work (found in the "cv", "cu", and "n" folders):
